# Comments on original code and modifications:----------------------------------
# 
# Issue 1: The author provided data file did not include several variables used 
#          in the analysis. We corrected the data file following the description
#          of data construction provided in the published article. 
#
# Issue 2: While measures of the response variables PD, FR, and SR were provided 
#          in the data file, how these variables were constructed is not 
#          described. Moreover, the original data used to produce these 
#          variables was not available, which limited their evaluation. 
#
# Issue 3: Procedures to construct the predictor variables forest structure and
#          understory density were not provided. Only the final values were 
#          provided. Original GEDI can be tracked down online, but cannot be 
#          used to construct the predictor variables.
# 
# Issue 4: The authors did not base the standardization of their predictors in 
#          the spillover analyses on the subsets of data used in those analyses. 
#          Rather the standardization from the full data set was carried into 
#          these analyses.

# Deviation 1: The data file shared by the original authors did not include the
# human development index (HDI) measure. Following the in-text description we 
# assigned each station the HDI of its country.

# Clarification 1: Brodie et al. identified two GEDI-based measures of forest 
# structure as the best fit for their diversity data. We follow their procedure, 
# but clarify the mapping of measure to concepts by matching variable names to 
# those used in the structural causal modelling

# Extension 1: We introduce 2 measures of station to PA connectivity, calculated
# following the procedures defined in calc_conn_metrics.R.
