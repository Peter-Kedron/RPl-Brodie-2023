# Code
Store computational code-based research procedures here.
Document an index of files stored here in [procedures_index.csv](../procedure_index.csv) the root [procedure](../) folder.

Before running the code, please download the shared data from figshare and Asia and Pacific protected area database from WDPA website, and put them in `data/public`.

- `bird_models_230326.R` is proofed so it can run.
- `mammal_models_230326.R` is not proofed yet, but should be very similar to `bird_models_230326.R`.
- `calc_conn_metrics.R` calculates multiple types of connectivity flux index.
