# Raw Public Data

- Files starting with `GEDI` are GEDI tree structure layers downloaded before the Brodie et al. (2024) correction to run the original data. All other files are downloaded from Brodie et al. (2023) and the correction.
- Folder `training` has the raw csv files for the model training downloaded from Brodie et al. (2023) to run the reproduction report.
